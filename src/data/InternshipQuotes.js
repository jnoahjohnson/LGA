      "My time with Logan Growth Advisors was, without a doubt, the single greatest factor that led to my placement at a bulge bracket investment bank in New York. Learning skills like financial modeling, CIM construction, and fostering client relationships prepared me for my interviews and helped me stand out as a candidate that already had a good amount of M&A experience. I will always be grateful to Bob and Kevin for helping me set myself apart in the financial services industry, and I highly recommend that any aspiring finance professionals pursue an internship with LGA.",

      "LGA has a great team and learning platform that prepared me to start a career in IB. I had the opportunity to perform a wide variety of tasks like financial modeling, CIM work, and investors calls. Even though the internship was remote, the communication was constant which made me feel part of the team.",

      "My experience at LGA was grueling but worth every second. I loved the sink or float approach to the internship because it taught me to learn on the fly and constantly double check my work for quality assurance. Even though life as an investment banker can get hectic as deals are approaching close, this internship has been the best experience in investment banking that I could have ever hoped for. I feel confident enough to start on the desk tomorrow on Wall Street from not only the hard skills I was able to develop in modeling and PowerPoint, but also the soft skills I had the chance to improve, like communication with senior management, coordinating multiple projects simultaneously, and receiving constructive feedback. When underclassmen ask me about how they can prepare for careers in investment banking, LGA is the first place I steer them. I recommend this internship to everyone that I think has a chance of making a successful life for themselves in finance. Phenomenal opportunity.",
